I got tired of having to remember what work I had done in a week and then generate a report for my PhD supervisor every Friday so I automated it.

This is a very simple script which uses sendmail and rufus-scheduler to generate a report of any cards, in my "In Progress" and "Done" lists on my PhD Trello board, which have changed status in the previous 7 days. This report is then emailed to my supervisor on Friday afternoons.

The text for each item in the report is generated form the most recent comment on a card, or from the description field if there are no comments. This allows me to update the comments as I work so that an accurate status of the item is depicted in the report. I usually add a comment to each card I have worked on during the day specifying what I did, or am busy doing, this way my report reads nicely :)

Next step is to setup a Latex template will allow me to add some images to my report and have it in a pretty PDF format :P
